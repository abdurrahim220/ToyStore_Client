                        Refresh tokens allow you to balance your users' access needs with your organization's security practices. Access tokens help users get the resources they need to complete their tasks, but such tokens can also expose your organization to data compromise or other malicious actions if a hacker is able to steal them

                        Most major modern websites are dynamic â€” they store data on the server using some kind of database (server-side storage), then run server-side code to retrieve needed data, insert it into static page templates, and serve the resulting HTML to the client to be displayed by the user's browser.

                        Client-side storage works on similar principles, but has different uses. It consists of JavaScript APIs that allow you to store data on the client (i.e. on the user's machine) and then retrieve it when needed
